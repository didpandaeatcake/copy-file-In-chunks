# copy-file-In-chunks
**Python script to copy large file in chunks**

Some older file systems or specific storage devices (e.g., FAT32) have a **maximum file size limit**, often around **4GB**. Additionally, some network drives or protocols may impose restrictions on the size of files that can be transferred in a single operation. By using a **chunked file copy method**, you can bypass these limitations by transferring the file in smaller, manageable pieces. This approach not only helps you work around size restrictions but also provides better control over the transfer process, such as resuming interrupted transfers or monitoring progress.

## Key Benefits of Chunked File Copying

1. **Overcoming File System Limitations**:
   - Older file systems like **FAT32** cannot handle files larger than 4GB. Chunked copying allows you to split the file into smaller chunks that comply with this limit.

2. **Network Drive Compatibility**:
   - Some network drives or protocols (e.g., SMB, FTP) may have restrictions on the maximum file size that can be transferred in one go. Chunked copying ensures compatibility with such systems.

3. **Resumable Transfers**:
   - If the transfer is interrupted, it can be resumed from the last copied chunk, saving time and bandwidth.

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - You can monitor the progress of the transfer in real-time, providing transparency and control.

5. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Large files are handled without loading the entire file into memory, making the process more efficient and less resource-intensive.

## Example Use Cases

- **FAT32 File System**:
  - FAT32 cannot handle files larger than 4GB. Chunked copying allows you to split the file into smaller chunks that comply with this limit.

- **Network Drives**:
  - Some network drives or cloud storage services impose limits on file sizes for uploads or downloads. Chunked copying ensures smooth transfers.

- **Unstable Connections**:
  - For large file transfers over unstable networks, chunked copying allows you to resume the transfer from where it left off if the connection drops.

## How Chunked Copying Works

1. The file is divided into smaller chunks (e.g., 50MB, 100MB).
2. Each chunk is transferred individually.
3. The chunks are reassembled at the destination to recreate the original file.

By using a chunked file copy method, you can efficiently handle large files, work around system limitations, and ensure reliable transfers even in challenging environments.
